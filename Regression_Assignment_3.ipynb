    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term (L2 regularization) to the ordinary least squares regression. It helps to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients, leading to a more stable and less overfit model compared to ordinary least squares regression."

    "Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The assumptions of Ridge Regression are similar to ordinary least squares regression, including linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and normality of errors."

    "Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression can be selected through techniques like cross-validation or grid search to find the value that minimizes the error or provides the best trade-off between bias and variance."

    "Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes,?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection. It shrinks the coefficients towards zero, effectively reducing the impact of less important features and promoting sparsity in the model."

    "Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Ridge Regression performs well in the presence of multicollinearity by reducing the impact of correlated variables and providing more stable coefficient estimates compared to ordinary least squares regression."

    "Q6. Can Ridge Regression handle both categorical and continuous independent variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes, Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables by appropriately encoding the categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) before fitting the model."

    "Q7. How do you interpret the coefficients of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  The coefficients of Ridge Regression represent the impact of the corresponding independent variables on the dependent variable, considering the regularization effect. A larger magnitude indicates a stronger influence."
